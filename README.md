ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rudirocha!
After starting at the Portuguese government and startup projects, I jumped into other international adventures such as Rocket Internet, Kununu, and Hostelworld.
I'm currently working at AlphaSights as a Software Engineering Manager.
I'm a huge fan of teaching and supporting people in software development, I also spend some time exploring new technologies and playing with personal projects.
