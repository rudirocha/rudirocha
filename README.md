ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rudirocha!
After starting with Portuguese government and startup projects, I jumped into other international adventures such as Rocket Internet and Kununu and now I'm working as Software Engineer Manager at Hostelworld.

I'm huge fan of teaching and supporting people in software development!
